# Blue Team 03: Firewalls & IDS

## OUTLINE
1. Security Defense Layers
2. Controls
3. Failures & Assessments

<br>

## SECURITY DEFENSE LAYERS
1. Data Security
2. Application Security
3. Endpoint System Security
4. Network Security
5. Perimeter Security

<br>

## SECURITY DEFENSE LAYERS (EXAMPLES)
- Data
    - Encryption and Hashing
- Application
    - Security patches, firewalls
- Endpoints
    - Firewalls, HIDS (EDR), TPM, passwords, multi-factor, logging
- Network / Perimeter
    - IDS, IPS, firewalls, segmentation, border routers

<br>

## CONTROLS
- Administrative
- Physical
- Technical
- Preventive
- Detective
- Corrective

<br>

## ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS EXAMPLES
- Personnel security controls
- Separation of duties
- Dual Control
- Succession planning
- Cross-train employees
- Background checks
- Mandatory vacation time
- Termination procedures
- Legal

<br>

## LAYERS UPON LAYERS (LAYERED ENDPOINT SECURITY)
- Endpoints are often most at risk - USERS USE THESE!
- Passwords
- Encryption - Both file and disk
- Host firewalls / IPS
- DLP
- White/black listing
- Antimalware
- Logging
- Multi-factor authentication
- Block USB ports

<br>

## FOUR MODELS OF LAYERED SECURITY
- Uniform protection
- Protected enclaves
- Risk or threat based
- Information classification based

<br>

## Failures & Assessments
- Single points of failure
- Cascading failures
- Views of Architectures
- Operational
- Technical
- Logical 
- Human Failures - stories!

<br>

## SUMMARY 
1. Types of controls and defenses
2. All defenses have holes -> layer defenses
3. Failure points and assessments.
