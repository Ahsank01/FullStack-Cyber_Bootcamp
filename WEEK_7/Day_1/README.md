# Blue Team 06: Splunk Hunting

## SIEM
1. Dashboards
2. Analysis/Trends

<br>

## DASHBOARDS
- What do we do?
    - Act on alerts
    - Review data logs
    - Threat intelligence
    - Threat hunting
    - Vulnerability Scanning

<br>

## DASHBOARDS 
- Dashboards should be custom tailored for what you need to see!
- SIEMs allows for many different visulaization formats to help you make decisions.
- They also often provide tables
- Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
    - Quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an org, employee or other element

<br>

## DASHBOARDS
- What should we show?
    - Number of Failed log-ons
    - Number of vulnerable systems
    - Number of vulnerabilities
    - etc.

<br>

## ANALYSIS / DETECTION
- Analyst must resolve alert
    - True positive
    - False positive
- Conditional
    - Signature matching
- Heuristic
    - Machine learning
- Behavioral
    - Monitor network for abnormal sequences
- Anomaly 
    - Generate alert on any pattern that doesn't follow a set rule

<br>

## TRENDS
- Trend analysis
    - Detecting patterns in a data set over time and using those patterns to make future predictions OR better understand the past
- Frequency-based
    - Establish baseline and see how count changes over time
- Volume-based
    - Establish baseline and see how size changes over time
- Statistical deviation
    - Look at standard deviation to determine if data is out of standard range

## SUMMARY
1. What do you need to see?
2. What do you need to show?
3. How should you look approach looking for things?
